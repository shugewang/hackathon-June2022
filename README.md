# hackathon-June2022
Pride Month (Inclusion, Diversity &amp; Equality) Virtual &amp; Hybrid Hackathon organised by TH.O

In June 2022 I took part in my first Hackathon with a team of ClickMCR alumni, where we came in second place. The challenge was to find a solution to increase inclusion, diversity, and equality in sports in young people in the LGBTQ+ community.

Our idea was to create an online resource that is available on the school intranet and accessible to students of high school age (aged 13-19), especially to those who may be excluded or discouraged from participating in school sports. We aim to not only raise awareness of the issues that the LGBTQ youth community faces in the educational system, but also provide information on local LGBTQ-friendly sports clubs and social groups in the wider community. Through this, we create a robust support system that offers help and support for LGBTQ youth.

During the two-day Hackathon, we worked as a team to create a website that included the following pages: 

-> Local clubs/communities\
This section includes information on local clubs and communities and provide a way for LGBTQ youth to find LGBTQ-friendly sport clubs.

-> Sport inspirations\
This section provides information on successful LGBTQ people in sports and other fields.

-> Resources\
This providse information on LGBTQ themed media (films, TV, and books) and potentially a weekly online book club/discussion group.
This section will also include links to non-profit organisations that could provide advice and support (e.g. Mind, The Trevor Project).

-> Contact us\
This provides a way for young people to get in touch with mentors from the LGBTQ+ community.
